# HKTrafficMap

A simple Android app which fetches and interprets data from https://data.gov.hk/en/ to give a quick overview of the traffic situation in Hong Kong. The app shows a map scattered with markers, where each one represents a live camera feed. Click on of these markers to see the image.



# Compile and Execute

This is a standard Android Studio project, so to compile and execute you need to import it and run it with a virtual device or a connected Android device.

Alternatively you can build the application to get an APK file which can be run on any Android device with `Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK (s) > Build APK(s)` in Android Studio.
